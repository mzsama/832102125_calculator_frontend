This Android application is a calculator that allows users to perform mathematical calculations and store a history of their calculations. The app consists of two primary XML layout files:

1. **activity_main.xml**

   This layout is used for the main calculator interface. It includes an EditText field for input, a grid of buttons for various mathematical operations, and a TextView to display calculation results. Users can perform calculations, including basic arithmetic, exponentiation, trigonometric functions, and more.

2. **activity_history.xml**

   This layout is used to display the history of calculations. It includes a ListView to list the recent calculation results and a button to clear the history.

These XML layouts are part of the Android application's user interface (UI). The app provides the following functionality:

- Users can enter mathematical expressions in the main interface and calculate results.
- Results are displayed in the EditText field.
- The "History" button in the main interface allows users to view the history of calculations in the `activity_history` layout.
- Users can clear the history by tapping the "Clear the history" button in the `activity_history` layout.
