XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a markup language for describing data, not a programming language. However, XML code should still adhere to good code style practices to make it more understandable, maintainable, and collaborative. Here are some common XML code style suggestions:

(a)Consistency: Maintaining consistency is crucial. Use the same naming conventions, indentation, tag case (upper or lower), attribute quoting style, etc., throughout the entire XML document to improve readability and maintainability.

(b)Proper Indentation: Use indentation to represent the nesting structure to clearly present the document's hierarchy. Typically, each level of nesting is indented by a certain number of spaces or tabs.

(c)Naming of Tags and Attributes: Use descriptive tag and attribute names to make the document's content easy to understand. Generally, use lowercase letters with hyphens to separate multiple words, e.g., <user-info>.

(d)Comments: Use comments to explain the purpose and structure of the XML. This is helpful for others trying to understand the document.

(e)Attribute Quoting: Always use quotes around attribute values, typically double quotes, e.g., name="John".

(f)Self-Closing Tags: For tags with no child elements, you can use self-closing tags, such as <img src="image.jpg" />.

(g)Document Declaration: Begin the XML document with a document declaration specifying the XML version and character encoding, for example:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

(h)Namespaces: If namespaces are used, ensure that namespace declarations are clear and correctly referenced.

(i)Avoid Redundancy: Avoid unnecessary repetition. Do not store the same information in multiple places to reduce document size and complexity.

(j)Validation: In cases where strongly typed data is required, you can use tools like XML Schema or DTD to validate the structure and content of the XML document.
